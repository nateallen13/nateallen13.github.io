**Project description:** 

The Email Distribution PowerApp was built to address the following business requirements:
* Ability to quickly access and update Points of Contact (POC) - both internal external - associated to a specific account...in this case, Healthcare Facilities (HCF).
* Ability to send a report (as an attachment) to the HCF's Points of Contact with automated email language based on the report type.
* Ability to track reports that have already been sent
 
In order to achieve these business requirements, this app was built with the following features:
POINTS OF CONTACT SCREEN
* Quickly review the different POCs associated to each HCF based on a category
* Instantly unassign POCs from accounts in bulk (useful when accounting for internal/external staffing changes or portfolio assignment restructuring).
MONTHLY REPORT DISTRIBUTION SCREEN
* Filtering capabilities of existing HCF accounts
* Pre-populate email language based on user-defined inputs (ex: Account name, Report Type, Reporting Period, etc.)
* Filterable logging of reports for staff to know which reports have already been sent to specific HCFs.
*  Quality assurance measures incorporated:
    * Ability to review email language and make modifications either directly in app or by copy-paste from external text
    * Send Test Email to self to ensure the report email and attachments are correct
    * Verification of email accuracy input required before being able to send offical report email

This two-screen PowerApp delivers substantial power to end-users to ensure QA in the reports being sent, proper tracking of report history, and maintaining accurate Points of Contact internally and externally.
